      <h1 className="page-title">About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I’m a <strong>third-year Computer Science student at UBC</strong> who loves building systems that actually work and work fast. Whether it’s a full-stack web app, a Python automation script, or experimenting with ML/AI, I get a kick out of solving problems that challenge both my code and my thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Algorithmic thinking is my playground. I focus on optimizing runtime, tracking down elusive bugs, and designing software that is both elegant and efficient. I thrive in collaborative environments, like <strong>UBC Sailbot</strong>, where ideas evolve into tangible results.

      <p>
        I enjoy taking complex problems, breaking them down, and building solutions that just work, often better than expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I spend time at the gym, running trails, hiking mountains, or indulging my passion for cars and hockey. These activities keep my mind sharp and give me perspective when approaching challenging projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in <strong>systems programming, security, and performance engineering</strong> while preparing for internships that allow me to tackle meaningful technical problems. I aim to continue building software that is fast, smart, and impactful.
